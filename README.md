# CosmologicalPerturbations-TFG

This repository contains the code and numerical notebooks developed for an End-of-Deegree Project (TFG) focused on the study of cosmological perturbations during inflation, considering different models for inflation: a quartic potential, the Natural Inflation model and a model to form primordial black holes (PBH).

## Project Overview

The project explores the evolution of inflation, implemented with a scalar field, and its primordial perturbations. When inflation ends, the reheating process occurs, which is also examined. 

The project is organized into four Jupyter notebooks: 

* **1. Quartic Potential (background):** The first notebook solves the background dynamics of the inflaton field under a quartic potential. It is solve with exact numerical methods and with the slow-roll regime, comparing the results. The reheating process is also studied, with the field evolution and the equation of state during this phase. 
* **2. Quartic Potential (perturbations):** This notebook analyzes the inflation perturbations of the scalar and tensor cases. It is mainly focused on the scalar perturbations, showing the evolution of them for different variables ($\delta \phi$, $u$ and $\mathcal{R}$). The power spectrum is also obtained, along with the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) and the scalar spectral index ($n_s$). 
* **3. Natural Inflation:** This third notebook studies a different model than the previous ones, the Natural Inflation. This model has not been completely discarded by the last measurements of the CMB, so it is interesting to examine. We only analyze this model with the slow-roll approximations, varying the duration of inflation and one free parameter ($f$), in order to compare the results with the CMB constraints of the primordial perturbations. 
* **4. Inflation and PBHs:** This last notebook analyzes a more complex model of inflation, which can lead to the formation of PBHs. It is studied with the exact equations and with the slow-roll approximations, to see that this model cannot be computed only with the slow-roll regime, as it fails to reproduce the complete evolution of the inflation field. We solve the background dynamics and the primordial perturbations, examining also the reheating process.
